The default value of an uninitialized variable is undefined. This is a special data type that represents a value that does not have a definition yet.

You can still assign a value to an uninitialized variable. Here is an example:

Example Code
let uninitialized;
uninitialized = "assigned";
Assign the string "Test" to your secondCharacter variable below your declaration. Open the console to see how your log has changed.
*/

let character = 'Hello';
console.log(character);
character = "World";
let secondCharacter;
secondCharacter = "Test";
console.log(secondCharacter);
