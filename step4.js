JavaScript has seven primitive data types, with String being one of them. In JavaScript, a string represents a sequence of characters and can be enclosed in either single (') or double (") quotes.

Note that strings are immutable, which means once they are created, they cannot be changed. The variable can still be reassigned another value.

Change your "Hello" string to use single quotes.

let character = 'Hello';
