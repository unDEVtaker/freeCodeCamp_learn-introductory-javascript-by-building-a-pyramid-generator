/*
Step 19Passed
When an array holds values, or elements, those values are separated by commas. Here is an array that holds two strings:

Example Code
let array = ["first", "second"];
Change your rows declaration to be an array with the strings "Naomi", "Quincy", and "CamperChan". The order of values in an array is important, so follow that order. Remember that strings are case-sensitive.

let character = 'Hello';
let count = 8;
let rows = ["Naomi", "Quincy","CamperChan"];
