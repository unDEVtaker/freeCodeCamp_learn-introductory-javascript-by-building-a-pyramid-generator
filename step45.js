/*
Step 45
Now you have a series of # characters, but the pyramid shape is still missing. Fortunately, the i variable represents the current "row" number in your loop, enabling you to use it for crafting a pyramid-like structure.

To achieve this, you will use the .repeat() method available to strings. This method accepts a number as an argument, specifying the number of times to repeat the target string. For example, using .repeat() to generate the string "Code! Code! Code!":

Example Code
const activity = "Code! ";
activity.repeat(3);
Use the .repeat() method on your character, and give it i for the number.

const character = "#";
const count = 8;
const rows = [];

for (let i = 0; i < count; i = i + 1) {
  rows.push(character.repeat(i));
}

let result = ""

for (const row of rows) {
  result = result + row + "\n";
}

console.log(result);
