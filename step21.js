/*
Step 21Passed
Arrays are special in that they are considered mutable. This means you can change the value at an index directly.

For example, this code would assign the number 25 to the second element in the array:

Example Code
let array = [1, 2, 3];
array[1] = 25;
console.log(array); // prints [1, 25, 3]
Update the third element of your rows array to be the number 10. Then print the rows array to your console.
*/

let character = 'Hello';
let count = 8;
let rows = ["Naomi", "Quincy", "CamperChan"];
console.log(rows[0]);
rows[2] = 10;
console.log(rows);
