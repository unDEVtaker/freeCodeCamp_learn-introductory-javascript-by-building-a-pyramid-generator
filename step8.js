When variable names are more than one word, there are specific naming conventions for how you capitalize the words. In JavaScript, the convention to use is camel case.

Camel case means that the first word in the name is entirely lowercase, but the following words are all title-cased. Here are some examples of camel case:

Example Code
let variableOne;
let secondVariable;
let yetAnotherVariable;
let thisIsAnAbsurdlyLongName;
Use camel case to declare a new secondCharacter variable.

let character = 'Hello';
console.log(character);
character = "World";
console.log(character);
let secondCharacter;
