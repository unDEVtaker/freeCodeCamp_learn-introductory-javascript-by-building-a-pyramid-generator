Step 11Passed
You can also assign the value of a variable to another variable. For example:

Example Code
let first = "One";
let second = "Two";
second = first;
The second variable would now have the value "One".

To see this in action, change your secondCharacter assignment from "Test" to your character variable.

Then open the console to see what gets logged.

let character = 'Hello';
console.log(character);
character = "World";
let secondCharacter;
secondCharacter = character;
